# Image-Classifier-to-identify-Dog-Breeds

As a part of Udacity Nanodegree course - AI Programming with Python, the project Image Classifier to identify Dog Breeds. 

Principal Objectives :
1. Correclty identify which pet images are of dogs and pet images aren't of dogs
2. Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs
3. Determine which CNN model architecture(ResNet, AlexNet, VGG), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2
4. Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given amount of time each of the algorithms take to run
